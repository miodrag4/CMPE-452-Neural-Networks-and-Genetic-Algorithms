# CMPE-452-Neural-Networks-and-Genetic-Algorithms
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) for problem solving and prediction tasks such as classification, clustering, optimization and data reduction and modeling human cognition, with application to real world problems. Ongoing research in this area in various application domains.

# Assignment 1: Perceptrons
Emotion classification using a perceptron model. It showcases the implementation of simple feedback learning, with a focus on adjusting weights based on feedback information. The project uses a dataset from Kaggle and includes a custom-built evaluator function using PyTorch or Numpy. Key components of the project are the training and evaluation of the perceptron model, with evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. The repository contains code for model training, prediction, and performance evaluation, demonstrating practical applications of machine learning in emotion recognition.

# Assignment 2: Neural Networks
My implementation of a feedforward neural network from scratch using NumPy, as part of an academic assignment. The project involves developing a neural network with backpropagation for binary classification on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. Key features include custom network architecture with sigmoid activation, forward and backward propagation functions, and performance evaluation metrics. It showcases skills in basic machine learning algorithm development and understanding of neural network fundamentals.

# Assignment 3: Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning techniques like PCA and K-Means Clustering. The first part employs PCA for dimensionality reduction in sound data, and the second part utilizes K-Means for clustering a penguin dataset. The project highlights the use of Numpy for model building and evaluation, demonstrating an in-depth understanding of these key machine learning algorithms.

# Assignment 4: Theoretical + Programming Parts
Covers topics in neural networks and genetic algorithms. It includes theoretical analyses and practical implementations covering selection methods, schema theory, mutation probabilities, and a hands-on genetic algorithm project with various experimental setups and performance evaluations.

# Email Phishing Detection Neural Network
The "Phishing Email Detection" project presents an extensive study and implementation of a phishing detection system using LSTM neural networks. The project, guided by Prof. Hossein, involves the collaboration of Mile Stosic, Kieran Cosgrove, and Lucas Coster. The report covers the motivation, problem description, related work, dataset, and individual contributions in detail. Central to the project is the implementation of an LSTM-based neural network, complemented by dropout layers to prevent overfitting, ensuring generalizability on unseen data. The model, rigorously tested on a Kaggle-sourced dataset, showcases a high accuracy of 97.5%, underlining its effectiveness. The report also includes a discussion on the results, providing insights into the model's performance metrics and potential future enhancements.
